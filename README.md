# CryptoSim
Full-Stack Cryptocurrency & Stock Market Simulator

CryptoSim is a full-stack educational web application that simulates trading cryptocurrencies and stocks using virtual money.
The project was created by a two-person development team over several months as part of a school programming project.

The simulation allows users to log in, invest virtual funds, track real-time market prices, analyze price charts, and compare their performance on a public leaderboard — all in a fully safe, risk-free environment.
